# Pinball
This small project is based around a 2D pinball game based on the box2D library. The game consists of in making the maximum score until you lose your three lives.

On the [repository link](https://github.com/joseppi/Pinball) is posible to check for code and the release.

## Installation
Decompress the .zip file in any directory and execute the executable inside the decompressed folder.

## Functionalities
- The spring does impulse the ball for starting a new game.
- Flippers do move in limited angles to boost away from the ball.
- Bouncers (circular and triangular shapes) rebound the ball when hitting them. (The are two mini ones of them when actioning the       flippers; used for blocking the exit).
- Sensors make sure that when a bouncer is touched these change appearance.
- Score and lives mechanics are used when hitting the sensors and losing lives when the ball falls at the bottom of the pinball.
- Sound FX play at each mechanism (spring, flipper) is launched and when colliding too (bouncers), apart from the UI interaction. 

## Usage (keyboard)
- Left arrow: Activate left flipper and it's assigned mini bouncer (located behind the first wall).
- Right arrow: Activate right flipper and it's assigned mini bouncer (located behind the second wall).
- Spacebar: Apply force to the spring when starting a new game.
- R: Restart score and lives.

### Special features
- F1: Show logical 2D physics (shapes, figures and joints).
